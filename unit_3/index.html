<p id="slogan"> Art!</p>
<p>In all honesty, I'm trying to come up with a "business" idea to carry out for the rest of this project. I already have an online portfolio that I feel is sufficient for my needs. Taking this class to build my programming skills more than to showcase my art. Ideas welcome!</p>
